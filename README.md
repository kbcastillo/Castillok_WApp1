# Castillok_WApp1
The deliverable for WApp1 is a link to the github directory tree containing the full code and peripheral files for your initial Web Application project ready for me to download, compile, and execute as a delivered Web Application. This is the first milestone in a series, designated WApp1, WApp2, etc., leading to the final deliverable Web Application.
